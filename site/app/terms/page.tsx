				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold py-4">TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT</h2>
				<span className="text-gray-400"> Last Modified: 13 April 2023 </span>

				<p className="mt-16 mb-4">
					Welcome to openpeer.xyz, a website-hosted user interface (the "Interface" or "App") provided by
					OpenPeer Protocol ("we", "our", or "us"). The Interface provides access to a decentralised self
					custody peer to peer protocol on the Ethereum blockchain which allows users to trade crypto and fiat
					between each other through interaction with the OpenPeer Protocol smart contract infrastructure and
					web interface (the “OpenPeer Protocol" or "Protocol" or “Platform”). The Interface is one, but not
					the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. To use the Protocol, you must use non-custodial
					wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that
					non-custodial wallet is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this
					Terms of Service Agreement (the "<span className="font-bold">Agreement</span>").
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer Protocol will operate as a purely decentralised autonomous organisation governed by $P2P
					token holders pursuant to a delineated governance structure (the “OpenPeer Protocol DAO”, or the
					“Organisation”); providing oversight, maintenance and upgrade of the OpenPeer Protocol through the
					mechanisms of decentralised governance which may include but is not limited to and pending
					governance approval, creation of action groups with specific technical knowledge to handle system
					parameters and creation of other action groups to facilitate other functions and aspects of the
					Protocol. Such functions of decentralised governance will continue to govern all other facets of the
					Protocol and Organisation on a continuing basis and democratised governance will be unlimited in
					scope in relation to all functions related to the Protocol and Organisation.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") explains the terms and conditions by which you may
					access and use the Interface. You must read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or using the
					Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in
					its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Interface and should
					not use the Interface.
				</p>

				<div className="flex flex-col justify-center font-bold text-center py-8">
					<p className="mb-4">
						NOTICE: PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE INTERFACE. THIS

						INTERFACE IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO YOU - AND YOU SHOULD ONLY ACCESS THE INTERFACE - IF YOU AGREE
						COMPLETELY WITH THESE TERMS.

					contents. Accessing or using the Interface does not constitute a grant to you of any proprietary
					intellectual property or other rights in the Interface or its contents. The open source software
					associated with the Protocol may be subject to certain business licenses which you are aware of and
					which may impose significant restrictions on any attempts to fork, whether in whole or in part, the
					protocol, within the parameters of the license. You understand and acknowledge that an attempt to
					subvert, avoid or any other such act which diminish such licenses as they appear from time-to-time
					within the open source documentation may be remedied via an injunction against you or further
					addressed via any other method permitted by law.

				<p className="mb-4">
					materials you submit through the Interface. However, by uploading such information or materials, you
					grant us a worldwide, royalty-free and irrevocable licence to use, copy, distribute, publish and

				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					If (i) you satisfy all of the eligibility requirements set forth in the Terms, and (ii) your access

					Interface for any purpose not expressly permitted by the Terms is strictly prohibited. Unlike the
					Interface, the Protocol is composed entirely of open-source software running on the public Ethereum
					Blockchain and other blockchains and is not our proprietary property, subject to varying licences,
					if any, that may exist corresponding to the open source documentation, code or repository enforced
					and placed by us. Pursuant to the foregoing and notwithstanding the open-source nature of the
					protocol, we reserve the right to apply licensing to the software as appropriate from time-to-time
					in our sole and absolute discretion. If you have contributed to the open source protocol, whether in
					a trivial or significant fashion, you consent to any and all relicensing of the project. The
					Protocol may also run on the other blockchains to which the same clause applies.

					further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in
					this Agreement.

					blockchain technology, and blockchain-based software systems; and that you have a working knowledge
					of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other digital
					tokens and such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20), other digital token
					derivatives and complex financial derivative mechanisms and any other mechanisms pertaining to Web
					3.0 applications, which encompasses the use of web interfaces to interact with blockchain based
					applications. In particular, you understand that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible and
					that Web 3.0 applications have intrinsic and unique risks and such are understood, appreciated and
					assumed by you. You further understand that the markets for digital assets are highly volatile due
					to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and
					regulation. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks,
					do not own or control the Platform, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you
					experience while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume

					relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any such resources or participation in
					any such promotions.

					Organisation, Organisation members and participants and any other Organisation associated parties

					to your use of the Interface and your interaction with the Protocol. Notwithstanding any statutory
					provision applicable to your jurisdiction applying to loans taken from unidentified third parties
					and associated benefits and protections stemming from such statutory provisions, you agree to waive
					any and all benefits and protections to the fullest extent of the law of those provisions, in light
					of the status of the platform as decentralized and peer-to-peer and in light of the intrinsic
					anonymity principles of the blockchain.

					You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors,

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">Dispute Resolution</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					For the avoidance of doubt, this dispute resolution clause only applies to disputes that arise
					between You and OpenPeer Protocol. Disputes that arise between You and other parties involved in
					transactions are governed by the Trade Terms in Appendix 1.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith
					negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
					contact@openpeer.xyz, so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute
					resolution. If we aren't able to reach an informal resolution within eighty days of your email, then
					you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (“Dispute”), including questions
					regarding its existence, validity, or termination, or any other dispute arising out of the use of
					the protocol and interface shall initially be negotiated between the Parties in good faith a remedy
					to the specified breach. In the event no amicable negotiation is possible between the contracting
					parties and the effectiveness of negotiation is in doubt, it is agreed that all claims shall be
					subject first to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") Mediation Rules. In
					the event that neither negotiation in good faith nor remedy is able to solve the Dispute, the
					Dispute will then be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in London, United Kingdom. The
					tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator to be nominated by the Governance Token Issuer. The
					language of the arbitration shall be in English and governed by the laws of the United Kingdom.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in

					to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.

				<h3 className="mt-16 text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-center">APPENDIX 1 - TRADE TERMS</h3>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">POSTING OFFERS</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer users (the “Users”) may post offers to buy or sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for local
					FIAT currencies of their choice. Offers made on the Protocol are publicly available to everyone and
					can be viewed by all website visitors.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					The Protocol may display certain symbols next to a Users’ username which indicates certain
					information about a User such as their trade activity, response rate or standard hours of activity.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Offerors are allowed to write their own terms and conditions of sale, which may be published with
					the offer or negotiated with the offeree. The offeror must include the mandatory terms below in
					their terms and conditions.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">Limitation of Liability</h3>
				<p className="mb-4 italic">Dispute Resolution</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Any dispute arising between both the seller and the buyer shall initially be negotiated between both
					parties in good faith to reach a resolution. In the event that the dispute is not resolved, either
					party may refer the dispute to OpenPeer.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">Examples of disputes that may arise would be:</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6">
					<li className="mb-4">a party to a trade transfers local currency but the escrow isn’t released;</li>
					<li className="mb-4">
						local currency payment isn’t received and the cryptocurrency remains in escrow; or
					</li>
					<li className="mb-4">local currency is only part paid.</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mb-4">
					In the event that the dispute is referred to OpenPeer, the Protocol reserves the right to request a
					reasonable fee in order to resolve the issue. When the dispute is referred, both parties agree to
					waive confidentiality to their conversation history and all other information required by OpenPeer
					to resolve the dispute, including evidence of payment.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer will review the evidence and upon making a decision, transfer the cryptocurrency to the
					party who, in OpenPeer’s reasonable judgement, is entitled to it under the terms of sale.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Both parties acknowledge and agree that disputes may be arbitrated by third-parties including
					parties who stake $P2P, OpenPeer’s governance token.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Where OpenPeer requests further information from either party, the respective party must respond to
					the request for information promptly within 24 hours of that request. The inability to respond to
					the request for information within that timeframe may result in OpenPeer resolving the dispute in
					favour of the other party.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Both parties agree that the decision made by OpenPeer is final and binding, save for circumstances
					where gross negligence or fraud exists.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer reserves the right to refuse a referral to resolve a dispute where OpenPeer, in its sole
					and absolute discretion, considers that:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6">
					<li className="mb-4">the issue is best resolved through other methods;</li>
					<li className="mb-4">
						one or both parties have not provided all required or requested information;
					</li>
					<li className="mb-4">
						the ownership of cryptocurrency is not clear from the information provided;
					</li>
					<li className="mb-4">the contract between the parties is unlawful;</li>
					<li className="mb-4">a party is acting unlawfully or fraudulently;</li>
					<li className="mb-4">OpenPeer has a legal obligation to do so; or</li>
					<li className="mb-4">
						directing cryptocurrency to a party would cause OpenPeer to breach any law.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Where OpenPeer exercises its right to refuse to resolve a dispute, both parties will be duly
					notified of this decision. Either party may choose to continue negotiating a resolution or refer the
					matter to the Courts.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Where a party provides a Court order to OpenPeer and access to a digital signature that allows
					OpenPeer limited control of the escrow, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with the Court
					order.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4 italic">OpenPeer Fees</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					The Protocol charges a 0.3% transaction fee (the “Fee”) which is incurred by the offeror. The fee is
					charged in the cryptocurrency of exchange.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					The Fee is incorporated in all contracts between buyers and sellers that transact through the
					Protocol. The offer publicly displayed to Users is the amount expected to be received from the
					transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, this would mean that the Fee has already been priced in.{' '}
					<span className="underline underline-offset-1">
						This is not inclusive of network transaction fees.
					</span>
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">PROHIBITIONS</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					You must not use OpenPeer to advertise other products or services, such as gift cards, non-fungible
					tokens, precious metals, securities, real property or other real or virtual items. You must not
					advertise a cryptocurrency for sale that is not currently supported by the OpenPeer platform. You
					must not use OpenPeer to advertise buying or selling cryptocurrencies with a payment method that is
					not specified on the OpenPeer website.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer reserves the right to delete or suppress offers from the marketplace at its discretion.
					Generally, it will delete offers if they appear to be forbidden, unlawful, non-genuine, fraudulent,
					spam or are otherwise misleading or incorrect.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN TRANSACTORS</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer allows users to communicate over the OpenPeer Platform through end-to-end encrypted
					communications. This is provided through a third party tool.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					It is the Users’ sole responsibility to ensure that adequate records of communications, details of
					transactions and financial history are kept to the extent that they are required to do so by their
					respective laws in their respective jurisdictions.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					OpenPeer users shall respect other users and shall not engage in communication which is offensive,
					abusive, unlawful, defamatory, indecent or inappropriate.{' '}
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">TRADE OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					When You transact on the OpenPeer Protocol, payment instructions can only be communicated directly
					between both parties. The Protocol does not hold funds on account for users, nor does it facilitate
					or escrow any local currency payments between both the buyer and seller.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-bold">
					For the avoidance of doubt, except for transaction fees, at no point during the course of a
					transaction does the buyer’s or seller’s cryptocurrency enter the Protocol’s possession.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Transactions occur on the blockchain and are regulated by smart contracts that negate the need for
					traditional escrow. An illustration of how the smart contract works as follows:{' '}
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6">
					<li className="mb-4">
						ERC20 token trades are conducted via the Ethereum distributed computing network and other
						EMV-compatible networks, which we cannot and do not control. When a seller sends tokens to a
						buyer during the course of a trade, the seller transfers tokens directly to an escrow smart
						contract on the Ethereum blockchain. OpenPeer cannot access tokens held in escrow without
						explicit digital permission from the buyer or seller, and it is impossible for us to have tokens
						directed to anyone other than the seller or the buyer as per the code of the open source smart
						contract.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className="mb-4">
					More information regarding the technical workings of the non-custodial escrow mechanism can be found
					here.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					The Protocol reserves the right to update the code of the smart contract mechanisms from time to
					time, primarily for the purposes such as, but not limited to, improving cost efficiency,
					computational efficiency, bug fixes and security improvement works.{' '}
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Please contact the Protocol at contact@openpeer.xyz if You have a query regarding the non-custodial
					escrow mechanism.
				</p>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Once cryptocurrency is transferred into escrow, the trade should proceed in accordance with the
					terms agreed between the buyer and the seller. This will ordinarily require:
				</p>
				<ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
					<li className="mb-4">
						the buyer to transfer local currency to the seller using an agreed-upon payment method or
						service; and
					</li>
					<li className="mb-4">
						The release of cryptocurrency held in escrow once the payment has been received in full by the
						seller once local currency payment.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p className="mb-4">
					If the buyer does not confirm the sending of the payment within a defined period of time, the escrow
					may be cancelled by the seller. The buyer may cancel the escrow at any time.{' '}
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					If you are the party selling cryptocurrency, it’s important to make sure you and the other party
					have agreed all relevant terms of the trade before you fund the escrow, as you will be charged a fee
					by the relevant cryptocurrency network to fund an escrow even if it ends up being cancelled.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">Sales between buyers and sellers are subject to:</p>
				<ul className="list-disc pl-6">
					<li className="mb-2">the payment of OpenPeer’s fee;</li>
					<li className="mb-2">the process for resolving disputes set out in this Appendix; and</li>
					<li className="mb-2">
						the seller’s terms and conditions, or any other terms and conditions agreed between the buyer
						and the seller.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 className="mt-8 text-lg font-bold mb-4">SECURITY</h3>
				<p className="mb-4">
					In the event that OpenPeer requires You to comply with reasonable security requirements, You must
					comply with best efforts.

				<p className="mb-4">

					arising from your failure to pay the applicable taxes.

					extent that they are required to do so in their jurisdiction.{' '}
